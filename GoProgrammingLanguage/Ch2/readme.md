In Golang, there are specific names that are pre-declared  and can only used when it permits it. Otherwise, it represents the similar functionality such as true, false

Names are:

break        default      func         interface    select
case         defer        go           map          struct
chan         else         goto         package      switch
const        fallthrough  if           range        type
continue     for          import       return       var
